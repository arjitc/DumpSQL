DumpSQL
=======

DumpSQL is a no-brainer mySQL dump and backup script written in bash.

Features:
* Dumps database and backup via SCP.

Note:
I take no responsibility if this script will work for you as designed, you have to test and make sure this script will work in your environment as designed.

Howto:
Edit dump.sh and set the mysql user, mysql DB and mysql password and then set the remote host, remote host user and remote host password for SCP based backup.
